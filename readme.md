## Assignment Details

- **Company:** Swipe
- **Assignment Title:** Enhancing Invoice Creation and Product Management Feature

### Description

As part of the interview process, candidates were required to enhance the existing invoice creation functionality in a GitHub repository. The assignment focused on implementing a user-friendly products tab, enabling efficient management of associated products during invoice creation, and improving the overall user experience. Proper validation, error handling, and documentation were emphasized to maintain code quality. The system was built using React and Redux, extending an existing GitHub repository that already supported creating, viewing, editing, and deleting invoices individually.

### Used Technologies

- React
- Redux
- Bootstrap
- Vercel for deployment

## Approach

The approach taken involved building upon the existing codebase while implementing the specified requirements. Some enhancements were left unattended, such as form validations in inputs and implementing pagination at listings. However, these areas were considered for future improvements to further elevate the project's functionality and user experience.
